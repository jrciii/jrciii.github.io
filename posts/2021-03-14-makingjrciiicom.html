        <p>This site is generated by means of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> - For compiling this static website using a combination of html templates and org files</li>
<li>Various <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org</a> files (which I use to organize about every aspect of my life)</li>
<li><a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> (for syncing org files from multiple devices)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> editor for Org-mode and just general awesomeness and supplying us the whole world at our fingertips. At the time of this writing I am even using the <a href="https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm">Emacs X Window Manager (EXWM)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orgzly.com/">Orgzly</a> for basic editing of Org files on the go on my Android device, so that I can always save those fleeting ticklers or ideas and flesh them out in an organized way wherever I am. Besides being able to produce content for this site and other notes, I use it to keep track of my schedule and TODO lists on the go as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jrciii/site-generator/">Here is the source for this siteâ€™s generator</a></p>
<p>Hakyll, with the Pandoc compiler make it easy to fuse the daily chronicling of things I learn, notable events, and whatever tickles my fancy, with this site and by extension the rest of the world.</p>
<p>For example, a knowledge base composed of a directory of Org files that I will be editing on many different devices in many different locations, not just on the machine I will use to write posts. This knowledge base is symlinked from my syncthing folder to the site generator folder, where it gets compiled when I build my site. Basically all content on this site is compiled from org files linked from my main org repository.</p>
<p>There was one issue with the standard Hakyll example for achieving everything I want on this site. I want to export org files that link to other org files and have the links converted to the resulting .html files. <a href="2021-03-14-orglinktohtml.html">The solution is detailed in my next blog post</a>.</p>
