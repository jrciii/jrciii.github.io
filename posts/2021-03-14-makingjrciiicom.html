This site is generated by means of:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> - For compiling this static website using a combination of
html templates and org files</li>
<li>Various <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org</a> files (which I use to organize about every aspect of my life)</li>
<li><a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> (for syncing org files from multiple devices)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> editor for Org-mode and just general awesomeness and supplying
us the whole world at our fingertips. At the time of this writing I
am even using the <a href="https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm">Emacs X Window Manager (EXWM)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.orgzly.com/">Orgzly</a> for basic editing of Org files on the go on my Android
device, so that I can always save those fleeting ticklers or ideas and flesh
them out in an organized way wherever I am. Besides being able to
produce content for this site and other notes, I use it to keep track of my schedule
and TODO lists on the go as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/jrciii/site-generator/">Here is the source for this site&rsquo;s generator</a>
</p>

<p>
Hakyll, with the Pandoc compiler make it easy to fuse the daily
chronicling of things I learn, notable events, and whatever tickles my
fancy, with this site and by extension the rest of the world.
</p>

<p>
For example, a knowledge base composed of a directory of Org files
 that I will be editing on many different devices in many different
 locations, not just on the machine I will use to write posts. This
 knowledge base is symlinked from my syncthing folder to the site
 generator folder, where it gets compiled when I build my
 site. Basically all content on this site is compiled from org files
 linked from my main org repository.
</p>

<p>
There was one issue with the standard Hakyll example for achieving
everything I want on this site. I want to export org files that link
to other org files and have the links converted to the resulting .html
files. <a href="2021-03-14-orglinktohtml.html">The solution is detailed in my next blog post</a>.
